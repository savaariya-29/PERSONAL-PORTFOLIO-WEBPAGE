##project Description: Personal Portfolio Webpage

Description:
The project involves designing and developing a responsive single-page portfolio website using HTML and CSS to showcase the profile and projects of an aspiring Data Analyst. The website is fully navigable through a sticky navigation bar that smoothly scrolls to various sections of the page including Home, About, Projects, and Contact.

The visual design incorporates a data-themed background image to reflect the career path and domain expertise. The layout is user-friendly, mobile-responsive, and visually engaging, making it suitable for online professional presence and personal branding.
